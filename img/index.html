<p style="font-family:'Courier New', Courier, monospace">Four kids are outside fighting over who gets to be a seeker as
  they play hide and seek. Once they all have decided they go their separate ways and now we are focused on this little
  boy Ali who gets distracted by a beautiful butterfly and then it leads him to this beautiful house… or so it seems.
  Ali then with no hesitation enters the house out of childish curiosity. Once he enters the house and everyone has
  already been found but now they have to find Ali who just went into the house, he sees that there is so much empty
  space and the house looks creepy and dusty,not as nice,clean,or bright as he thought it would be. As he walks in
  slowly he steps on this funny looking doll and picks it up and then it starts to slowly turn its head and talk…
  “Welcome ya Ali" after the doll says this, the door starts shutting with a powerful force of wind and the temperature
  starts to freeze up in the mansion, as the door was shutting the boy Ali managaed to escaped with a flight instinct.
  Ali then went to tell all his friends about what happen and then they get scared and start running away from the area.
  THE END. </p>
